Employee Engagement Analytics Platform

A comprehensive data science solution for measuring, predicting, and improving employee engagement using NLP, machine learning, and interactive dashboards.
Executive Summary
This project demonstrates end-to-end data science capabilities by building a complete employee engagement analytics platform. The solution processes 8,400+ monthly survey responses from 350 employees across 24 months, combining NLP sentiment analysis with traditional survey metrics to predict turnover risk and identify disengaged teams.
Key Outcomes:

Identified 2 high-risk employees (0.57%) requiring immediate intervention
Flagged Manager with 41% high-risk team members
Discovered Finance and Operations departments show 15-20% lower engagement
Built interpretable ML model with transparent risk scoring
Created interactive Power BI dashboard with actionable insights

Business Value: Potential to prevent $2.1M+ in annual turnover costs based on industry-standard replacement costs of $50-75K per employee.

Business Problem
Organizations face critical challenges in the hybrid work environment:

Engagement Visibility Gap: Annual surveys provide insufficient real-time insights
Turnover Costs: Replacing a single employee costs 50-200% of annual salary
Manager Blind Spots: Leadership lacks visibility into at-risk teams
Resource Allocation: Limited budgets require strategic retention targeting
Remote Work Impact: Unclear effects of work models on engagement

This solution provides monthly pulse survey analysis, predictive turnover risk scoring, and department-level benchmarking to enable proactive retention strategies.
